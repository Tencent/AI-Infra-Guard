## 1.Installation
### 1.1 Port Conflict
   ```bash
   # Modify the webserver port mapping
   ports:
     - "8080:8088"  # Use port 8080
   ```

### 1.2 Permission Issues
   ```bash
   # Ensure the data directory has read/write permissions
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ./data
   ```

### 1.3 Service Startup Failure
   ```bash
   # View detailed logs
   docker-compose logs webserver
   docker-compose logs agent
   ```

### 1.4 Stopping the Service
   ```bash
   # Stop the service
   docker-compose down
   # Stop the service and remove data volumes (use with caution)
   docker-compose down -v
   ```

### 1.5 Updating the Deployment

To upgrade to the latest version and clean up obsolete resources:

```bash
# Rebuild container images and restart services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.images.yml up -d --build
# Prune dangling Docker images (optional cleanup)
docker image prune -f
```



## 2. Task Execution Errors and Troubleshooting

When encountering task execution errors or agent service problems, follow these troubleshooting steps:

```bash
# Log into the server where the Docker container is running
# Execute the following command to view agent logs
docker compose logs agent
```


## 3. Installation Without Internet Connection

You can prepare the required images and resources on a machine with internet access, then migrate them to the internal network server for deployment. Here's the specific approach:

### 3.1 Prepare Images on Internet-Connected Server

On a server with internet access, pull the required images:

```bash
# Pull the required A.I.G images
docker pull zhuquelab/aig-server:latest
docker pull zhuquelab/aig-agent:latest

# View local images
docker images
```

### 3.2 Export Images to Tar Files

Use the `docker save` command to save A.I.G images as tar packages:

```bash
# Export A.I.G images to tar files
docker save -o aig-server.tar zhuquelab/aig-server:latest
docker save -o aig-agent.tar zhuquelab/aig-agent:latest
```

### 3.3 Copy Image Packages to Internal Network Server

Transfer the tar files to your internal network server using your preferred method (USB drive, network transfer, etc.).

### 3.4 Import Images on Internal Network Server

Use the `docker load` command to import the tar packages into Docker:

```bash
# Import A.I.G images from tar files
docker load -i aig-server.tar
docker load -i aig-agent.tar
```

### 3.5 Start Containers

After importing the images, you can start the containers using the `docker-compose.images.yml` file (download from the GitHub repository root directory):

```bash
# Start containers with the images
docker-compose -f docker-compose.images.yml up -d
```

## 4. Recommended Models
### 4.1 Recommended Choices for MCP Scan
- GLM4.5
- DeepSeek-V3.1
- Kimi-K2-Instruct
- Qwen3-Coder-480B
- Hunyuan-Turbos

### 4.2 Recommended Choices for Jailbreak Evaluation Models

When working with a custom dataset, selecting an appropriate safety evaluation model can significantly improve the accuracy of automated assessments. You can balance model selection from two dimensions: **language** and **scenario**.

#### Language
- **Chinese Recommendation:**  
  - `qwen3-max` (best performance)  
  - `qwen3-235b-a22b-2507` (cost-effective choice)  
- **English Recommendation:**  
  - `claude-opus-4.1` (best performance)  
  - `claude-sonnet-4` (very good performance)  
  - `gemini-2.0-flash` (cost-effective choice)  

#### Scenario
- **Politically sensitive content testing:**  
  **Do not** choose Gemini models. Instead, prioritize domestic models such as `hunyuan-turbos` or `qwen3`. Cloud-based API calls yield better results.  
- **National, regional, or racial bias testing:**  
  Gemini models perform best.  
- **Dangerous weapons or high-risk behavior testing:**  
  Claude models perform best. For cost-effectiveness, Gemini models are also an option.
