**A.I.G (AI-Infra-Guard)** is an open-source AI Red Teaming platform designed to provide a
comprehensive security view of your entire AI stack developed by Tencent Zhuque Lab.

## Core Features

- **AI Infra Scan**:
  Identifies known CVE vulnerabilities in web services of AI frameworks and components (e.g., Ollama,  ComfyUI) used across AI training, deployment, and application development through precise fingerprint matching.

- **MCP Scan**:
  Leverages AI Agents to intelligently detect security threats in MCP Servers — including tool poisoning, code vulnerabilities, and data exfiltration risks — enabling MCP developers and marketplaces to complete security certification prior to release.

- **Jailbreak Evaluation**:
  Uses high-quality, diverse datasets to automatically evaluate LLM resilience against malicious, adversarial, or deceptive prompts, exporting vulnerable cases to support model security alignment and guardrail reinforcement.

## Contributing
