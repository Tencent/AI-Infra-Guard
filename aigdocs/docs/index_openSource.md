**A.I.G (AI-Infra-Guard)** is a comprehensive, intelligent, and user-friendly AI Red Teaming security testing platform developed by Tencent Zhuque Lab.

## Core Features

- **AI Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning**: Detects known CVE vulnerabilities in the web services of various frameworks and components (e.g., Ollama, ComfyUI) used in AI training, deployment, and application building, through precise fingerprinting.
- **MCP Server Security Detection**: Utilizes AI Agents to intelligently detect security threats in MCP Servers, such as tool poisoning and code vulnerabilities, helping MCP developers and app marketplaces complete security certification before release.
- **Large Model Security Health Check**: Employs high-quality and diverse evaluation datasets to automatically assess the overall security of different large models when faced with malicious, adversarial, or deceptive prompt inputs. It exports bad cases for security alignment and guardrail reinforcement.
