  name: LiteLLM
  cve: CVE-2024-4889
  summary: Code injection vulnerability in LiteLLM via unsafe eval usage in secret management
  details: |
    A code injection vulnerability exists in LiteLLM version 1.34.6 due to unvalidated input being passed to the `eval` function within the secret management system.
    An attacker with access to a valid Google KMS configuration can exploit this by setting the `UI_LOGO_PATH` variable to a remote server address in the `get_image` function.
    This allows writing a malicious Google KMS config to `cached_logo.jpg`, which can then be used to execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious content into the `SAVE_CONFIG_TO_DB` environment variable.
    Successful exploitation leads to full system control, but requires prior access to Google KMS functionality.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade LiteLLM to a patched version (if available) or apply vendor-provided fixes
    2. Avoid using the Google KMS feature if not strictly necessary
    3. Sanitize and validate all inputs, especially those processed by functions that use `eval`
    4. Restrict access to environment variables that influence runtime behavior
rule: version == "1.34.6"
