  name: LiteLLM
  cve: CVE-2024-4890
  summary: Blind SQL injection vulnerability in LiteLLM's /team/update endpoint
  details: |
    A blind SQL injection vulnerability was identified in LiteLLM version 1.27.14 within the `/team/update` process.
    The issue occurs due to improper sanitization of the `user_id` parameter in a raw SQL query used for deleting users.
    This allows an authenticated attacker with low privileges to inject malicious SQL commands, potentially accessing
    sensitive data such as API keys, user information, and tokens stored in the database.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to a patched version of LiteLLM (version > 1.27.14).
    2. Sanitize all user-supplied inputs, especially parameters used in raw SQL queries.
    3. Use parameterized queries or ORM methods to prevent direct SQL injection.
rule: version <= "1.27.14"
