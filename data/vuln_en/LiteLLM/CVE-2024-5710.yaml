  summary: Improper access control in LiteLLM team management functionality
  details: |
    LiteLLM version 1.34.34 is vulnerable to improper access control in its team management endpoints.
    Insufficient authorization checks allow attackers with low privileges to perform unauthorized actions,
    including creating, updating, deleting, blocking/unblocking teams, and managing team members.
    The issue arises from missing or weak access control validations in the affected API routes.
