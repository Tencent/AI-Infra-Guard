  name: LiteLLM
  cve: CVE-2024-5751
  summary: Remote code execution vulnerability in LiteLLM due to unsafe use of eval
  details: |
    LiteLLM version v1.35.8 is vulnerable to remote code execution via the `add_deployment` function.
    The function decodes and decrypts base64-encoded environment variables and unsafely assigns them to `os.environ`.
    An attacker can send a malicious payload to the `/config/update` endpoint. When the `get_secret` function processes this,
    the payload gets executed. This vulnerability requires the server to be configured with Google KMS and a database for model storage.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to LiteLLM version 1.40.16 or later.
    2. Avoid processing untrusted configuration updates via endpoints like `/config/update`.
    3. Sanitize and validate all inputs, especially those influencing environment variable assignments.
rule: version >= "0" && version < "1.40.16"
