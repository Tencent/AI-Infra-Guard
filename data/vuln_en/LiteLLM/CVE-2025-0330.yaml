  name: LiteLLM
  cve: CVE-2025-0330
  summary: LiteLLM leaks Langfuse API keys when parsing team settings fails
  details: |
    In LiteLLM version v1.52.1, an error handling flaw in `proxy_server.py` leads to the exposure of Langfuse API credentials.
    When an exception occurs during the parsing of team settings, sensitive data such as `langfuse_secret` and `langfuse_public_key`
    are included in the error response, potentially granting attackers full access to the associated Langfuse project and all stored requests.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade LiteLLM to a version that resolves this issue (>= v1.52.2 if available).
    2. Sanitize error responses to prevent leakage of sensitive configuration data.
    3. Audit logs and monitor for unauthorized access to Langfuse projects.
