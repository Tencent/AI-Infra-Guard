  cve: CVE-2025-0628
  summary: Improper authorization allows privilege escalation to PROXY ADMIN in LiteLLM
  details: |
    An improper authorization vulnerability exists in LiteLLM's main-latest version. 
    Users with the 'internal_user_viewer' role are granted an overly privileged API key, 
    which can be used to access administrative endpoints such as `/users/list` and `/users/get_users`. 
    This flaw enables any authenticated user to escalate privileges and gain full admin access.

  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to LiteLLM version 1.61.15 or later.
    2. Review and restrict API key permissions for low-privileged roles.
    3. Audit existing keys for unauthorized admin-level usage.
rule: version >= "0" && version < "1.61.15"
