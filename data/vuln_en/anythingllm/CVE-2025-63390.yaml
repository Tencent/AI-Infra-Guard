  summary: Authentication bypass in AnythingLLM via /api/workspaces endpoint.
  details: |
    An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in AnythingLLM v1.8.5 via the `/api/workspaces` endpoint.
    The endpoint fails to implement proper authentication checks, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers
    to enumerate and retrieve detailed information about all configured workspaces. Exposed data includes:
    workspace identifiers (id, name, slug), AI model configurations (chatProvider, chatModel, agentProvider),
    system prompts (openAiPrompt), operational parameters (temperature, history length, similarity thresholds),
    vector search settings, chat modes, and timestamps.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade AnythingLLM to a version that includes a fix for this authentication bypass.
    2. Implement proper authentication and authorization checks for the `/api/workspaces` endpoint.
    3. Restrict access to sensitive workspace information to authenticated and authorized users only.
