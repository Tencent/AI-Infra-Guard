  name: dask
  cve: CVE-2024-10096
  summary: Command injection vulnerability via insecure deserialization in Dask (withdrawn)
  details: |
    This advisory was originally issued for a command injection vulnerability in Dask versions <=2024.8.2 due to unsafe use of pickle serialization. Attackers could craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized by the Dask server, would lead to remote code execution. However, this advisory has since been **withdrawn**, as the behavior was determined to be intended functionality related to the design of Dask's distributed computing model. See upstream documentation on [security limitations](https://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/limitations.html?highlight=host#security).
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: UNKNOWN
  security_advise: |
    1. Review the official withdrawal notice and linked documentation to understand the context.
    2. If running untrusted client code, consider sandboxing or restricting access to the Dask cluster.
    3. Follow best practices for secure deployment of distributed systems.
rule: version <= "2024.8.2"
