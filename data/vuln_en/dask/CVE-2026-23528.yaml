info:
  name: dask
  cve: CVE-2026-23528
  summary: Dask Distributed is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Jupyter Proxy and Dashboard due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug.
  details: |
    When Jupyter Lab, jupyter-server-proxy, and Dask distributed are all run together, a crafted URL can lead to code execution by Jupyter.
    Attackers can create a phishing URL that, when clicked by a user, opens an error page in the Dask Dashboard via the Jupyter Lab proxy,
    triggering code execution by the default Jupyter Python kernel. This requires the user to be running Jupyter Lab and a Dask distributed
    cluster on default ports.
  cvss: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade Dask distributed to version `2026.1.0` or newer.
    2. As a mitigation, uninstall `jupyter-server-proxy` and access the Dask dashboard directly.
    3. Consider running both Jupyter and the Dask dashboard on non-standard ports to reduce the chance of exploitation.
rule: version > "0" && version < "2026.1.0"
