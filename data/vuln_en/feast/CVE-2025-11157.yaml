  cve: CVE-2025-11157
  summary: Feast is vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data, leading to remote code execution.
  details: |
    A high-severity remote code execution vulnerability exists in feast-dev/feast version 0.53.0,
    specifically in the Kubernetes materializer job located at `feast/sdk/python/feast/infra/compute_engines/kubernetes/main.py`.
    The vulnerability arises from the use of `yaml.load(..., Loader=yaml.Loader)` to deserialize
    `/var/feast/feature_store.yaml` and `/var/feast/materialization_config.yaml`. This method allows for the
    instantiation of arbitrary Python objects, enabling an attacker with the ability to modify these YAML files
    to execute OS commands on the worker pod. This vulnerability can be exploited before the configuration is
    validated, potentially leading to cluster takeover, data poisoning, and supply-chain sabotage.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade Feast to version 0.54.0 or later.
    2. Ensure that YAML configuration files (`/var/feast/feature_store.yaml` and `/var/feast/materialization_config.yaml`)
       are not modifiable by untrusted users.
    3. Implement strict access controls and validation for any configuration files processed by Feast.
rule: version > "0" && version < "0.54.0"
