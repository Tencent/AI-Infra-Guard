info:
  name: jupyter-notebook
  cve: CVE-2025-53000
  summary: nbconvert has an uncontrolled search path that leads to unauthorized code execution on Windows.
  details: |
    The vulnerability in `nbconvert` on Windows systems allows for unauthorized code execution when converting notebooks containing SVG output to PDF. This is due to an uncontrolled search path element (CWE-427) where `nbconvert` searches for an `inkscape` executable. An attacker can place a malicious `inkscape.bat` file in the current working directory, which will be executed when `jupyter nbconvert --to pdf` is run, leading to arbitrary code execution.
  cvss: CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade `nbconvert` to a version greater than `7.16.6`.
    2. Avoid running `jupyter nbconvert --to pdf` in untrusted directories on Windows.
    3. Ensure that the `inkscape` executable is properly configured in the system's PATH environment variable to prevent the loading of malicious scripts.
rule: version > "0" && version <= "7.16.6"
