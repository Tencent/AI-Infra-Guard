  cve: CVE-2025-67644
  summary: LangGraph's SQLite checkpointer is vulnerable to SQL injection via metadata filter keys.
  details: |
    A SQL injection vulnerability exists in LangGraph's SQLite checkpoint implementation.
    Attackers can manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious metadata filter keys,
    allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This affects
    applications that accept untrusted metadata filter keys in checkpoint search operations.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Update to the patched version of `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite` (>=3.0.1).
    2. Audit your code for locations where filter keys are derived from untrusted sources and ensure proper validation.
rule: version > "0" && version < "3.0.1"
