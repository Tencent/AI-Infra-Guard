  cve: CVE-2024-7297
  summary: Privilege escalation vulnerability in Langflow allows low-privileged users to gain super admin access.
  details: |
    Langflow versions prior to 1.0.13 are affected by a privilege escalation flaw caused by insecure handling of mass assignment requests on the `/api/v1/users` endpoint. A remote attacker with low privileges can exploit this to elevate their permissions to super admin, potentially gaining full control over the application.
