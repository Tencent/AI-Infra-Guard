  name: langflow
  cve: CVE-2024-9277
  summary: Inefficient regular expression complexity in Langflow leads to potential ReDoS
  details: |
    A vulnerability was discovered in Langflow up to version 1.0.18 involving inefficient regular expression handling in the HTTP POST Request Handler component. Specifically, the issue arises from the `remaining_text` argument manipulation in `src/backend/base/langflow/interface/utils.py`, which can result in Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). This allows attackers within the local network to cause denial of service via crafted input. The vendor was notified but did not respond.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to langflow version >= 1.0.19 if available with patched regex handling
    2. Apply input validation and timeouts for user-controlled regex operations
    3. Monitor and restrict access to the affected API endpoints
rule: version > "0" && version < "1.0.19"
