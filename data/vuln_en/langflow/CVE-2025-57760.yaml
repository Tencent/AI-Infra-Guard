  cve: CVE-2025-57760
  summary: Langflow is vulnerable to privilege escalation via CLI superuser creation after remote code execution.
  details: |
    A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Langflow containers where an authenticated user with RCE access can invoke the internal CLI command `langflow superuser` to create a new administrative user. This grants full superuser access, even if the user initially registered through the UI as a regular (non-admin) account, effectively bypassing frontend role enforcement and backend user integrity.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade `langflow` to version `1.5.1` or later.
    2. Upgrade `langflow-base` to version `0.5.1` or later.
    3. Ensure that only authorized users have access to execute commands within the Langflow container.
    4. Implement strict access controls and monitoring for the `/api/v1/validate/code` endpoint.
rule: version > "0" && version < "1.5.1"
