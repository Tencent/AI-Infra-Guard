  name: langflow
  cve: CVE-2025-68477
  summary: Langflow is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to improper validation of user-supplied URLs in its API Request component.
  details: |
    The Langflow API Request component allows users to issue arbitrary HTTP requests within a flow. This component performs only basic URL normalization and format checks, failing to block private IP ranges (e.g., 127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) or cloud metadata endpoints (e.g., 169.254.169.254). Since flow execution endpoints can be invoked with just an API key, an attacker who can control the API Request URL in a flow can achieve non-blind SSRF. This enables access to internal resources, information disclosure from administrative endpoints, metadata services, and internal databases, providing a foothold for further attacks.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade Langflow to version 1.7.1 or later.
    2. Implement strict validation and blocking of private IP ranges and sensitive internal endpoints for any user-supplied URLs.
    3. Ensure that the API Request component does not return raw response bodies from internal requests to prevent non-blind SSRF.
rule: version > "0" && version < "1.7.1"
