  name: langflow
  cve: CVE-2025-68478
  summary: External Control of File Name or Path in Langflow allows authenticated arbitrary file write.
  details: |
    The vulnerability in Langflow arises from improper handling of the `fs_path` parameter in the request body.
    An authenticated attacker can specify an arbitrary file path, leading to the server serializing a Flow object
    into JSON and writing/overwriting a file at that location. This allows for authenticated arbitrary file write
    within the server's permission scope, potentially corrupting files, disrupting application behavior, or tampering
    with data. Both absolute and relative paths are allowed, increasing the risk of overwriting system files.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade Langflow to version 1.7.1 or later.
    2. In production environments, enforce a save root for file operations.
    3. Implement path normalization and block symlink traversal to prevent directory traversal attacks.
    4. Minimize permissions for the Langflow application to limit the impact of potential file writes.
rule: version > "0" && version < "1.7.1"
