  name: langflow
  cve: CVE-2026-0768
  summary: Langflow suffers from a remote code execution vulnerability due to improper validation of user-supplied code.
  details: |
    The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Langflow installations without authentication.
    The flaw is located within the handling of the `code` parameter provided to the `validate` endpoint.
    It results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute Python code,
    allowing an attacker to execute code in the context of root.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade Langflow to a patched version as soon as it becomes available.
    2. Implement strict input validation for all user-supplied code parameters.
    3. Restrict access to the `validate` endpoint to trusted users or internal networks if possible.
