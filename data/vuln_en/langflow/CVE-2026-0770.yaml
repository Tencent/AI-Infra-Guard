  cve: CVE-2026-0770
  summary: Langflow remote code execution vulnerability via exec_globals parameter.
  details: |
    The vulnerability in Langflow allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to improper handling of the `exec_globals` parameter in the `validate` endpoint. This flaw arises from the inclusion of a resource from an untrusted control sphere, enabling an attacker to execute code with root privileges without authentication.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. Update Langflow to a patched version as soon as it becomes available.
    2. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the `exec_globals` parameter.
    3. Restrict network access to the `validate` endpoint to trusted sources only.
