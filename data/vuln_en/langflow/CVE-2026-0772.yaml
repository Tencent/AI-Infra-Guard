  summary: Langflow Disk Cache Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
  details: |
    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Langflow.
    The specific flaw exists within the disk cache service due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data,
    which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute
    code in the context of the service account. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
