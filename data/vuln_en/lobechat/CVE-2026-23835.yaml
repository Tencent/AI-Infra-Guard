info:
  name: LobeChat
  cve: CVE-2026-23835
  summary: LobeHub is vulnerable to improper authorization in its presigned upload feature, allowing attackers to manipulate file sizes and paths.
  details: |
    The file upload feature in `Knowledge Base > File Upload` does not validate the integrity of the upload request. This allows users to intercept and modify request parameters, enabling the creation of arbitrary files in unintended paths. Additionally, attackers can manipulate the `size` parameter to bypass monthly upload quotas, misrepresenting actual file sizes and potentially causing financial impact, service degradation, and denial of service.
  cvss: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade LobeChat to version `1.143.3` or later.
    2. Implement server-side validation for file upload requests, specifically for file size and path parameters.
    3. Ensure that the actual file size is verified against the reported size to prevent quota bypasses.
rule: version > "0" && version < "1.143.3"
