info:
  name: mlflow
  cve: CVE-2025-10279
  summary: mlflow creates temporary files in directories with insecure permissions.
  details: |
    In mlflow version 2.20.3, the temporary directory used for creating Python virtual environments is assigned insecure world-writable permissions (0o777). 
    This vulnerability allows an attacker with write access to the `/tmp` directory to exploit a race condition and overwrite `.py` files in the virtual environment, 
    leading to arbitrary code execution.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to mlflow version 3.4.0 or later.
    2. Ensure that temporary directories used for virtual environments have secure permissions.
