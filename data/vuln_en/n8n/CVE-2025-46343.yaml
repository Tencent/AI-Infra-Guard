info:
  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2025-46343
  summary: n8n is vulnerable to Stored XSS through the Attachments View Endpoint, allowing authenticated attackers to execute malicious JavaScript.
  details: |
    n8n workflows can store and serve binary files, and previously lacked restrictions on the MIME type of uploaded files, which could be controlled via a GET parameter. This allowed the server to respond with any MIME type, potentially enabling malicious content to be interpreted and executed by the browser.
    An authenticated attacker with member-level permissions could exploit this by uploading a crafted HTML file containing malicious JavaScript. When another user visits the binary data endpoint with the MIME type set to text/html, the script executes in the context of the user’s session, potentially leading to account takeover.
