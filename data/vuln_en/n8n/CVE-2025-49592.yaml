  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2025-49592
  summary: n8n allows open redirects via the /signin endpoint, potentially leading to phishing attacks and credential theft.
  details: |
    This is an Open Redirect (CWE-601) vulnerability in the login flow of n8n. Authenticated users can be redirected to untrusted, attacker-controlled domains after logging in, by crafting malicious URLs with a misleading redirect query parameter. This may lead to phishing attacks by impersonating the n8n UI on lookalike domains, credential or 2FA theft if users are tricked into re-entering sensitive information, and reputation risk. The vulnerability affects anyone hosting n8n and exposing the `/signin` endpoint to users.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n version 1.98.0 or later.
    2. The fix introduces strict origin validation for redirect URLs, ensuring only same-origin or relative paths are allowed after login.
