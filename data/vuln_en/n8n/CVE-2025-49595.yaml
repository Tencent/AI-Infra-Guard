  cve: CVE-2025-49595
  summary: n8n is vulnerable to Denial of Service via malformed binary data requests to the `/rest/binary-data` endpoint.
  details: |
    An authenticated attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending GET requests with empty filesystem URIs (`filesystem://` or `filesystem-v2://`) to the `/rest/binary-data` endpoint. This leads to resource exhaustion and service disruption, affecting both self-hosted n8n instances and n8n.cloud.
