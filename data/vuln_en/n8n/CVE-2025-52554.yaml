info:
  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2025-52554
  summary: n8n is vulnerable to improper authorization through its `/stop` endpoint, allowing authenticated users to stop workflow executions they do not own.
  details: |
    An authorization vulnerability was discovered in the `/rest/executions/:id/stop` endpoint of n8n. While most API methods enforce user-scoped access, this endpoint fails to do so. An authenticated attacker can guess or enumerate sequential execution IDs to terminate active workflows initiated by other users, leading to potential business disruption and denial of service for critical automations.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n version >= 1.99.1.
    2. As a workaround, restrict access to the `/rest/executions/:id/stop` endpoint via a reverse proxy or API gateway.
rule: version > "0" && version < "1.99.1"
