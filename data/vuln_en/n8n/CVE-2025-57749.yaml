  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2025-57749
  summary: n8n symlink traversal vulnerability in "Read/Write File" node allows access to restricted files.
  details: |
    A symlink traversal vulnerability exists in the `Read/Write File` node in n8n. The node's restrictions on sensitive directories and files can be bypassed by an attacker who can create symbolic links, for example, using the `Execute Command` node. This allows unauthorized reading from or writing to otherwise inaccessible paths. Users of n8n.cloud are not affected.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n version 1.106.0 or later.
    2. Until patched, disable or restrict access to the `Execute Command` node and any other nodes allowing arbitrary file system access.
    3. Avoid using the `Read/Write File` node on untrusted paths or inputs that could be manipulated via symlinks.
rule: version > "0" && version < "1.106.0"
