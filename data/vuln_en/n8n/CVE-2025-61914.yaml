info:
  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2025-61914
  summary: n8n's "Respond to Webhook" node may allow stored XSS to execute outside an iframe sandbox.
  details: |
    A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in n8n's "Respond to Webhook" node.
    If this node responds with HTML containing executable scripts, the payload might execute directly in the top-level window instead of the intended sandbox.
    This allows malicious actors with workflow creation permissions to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the n8n editor, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, workflow modification, or data exfiltration.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n version 1.114.0 or later.
    2. Restrict workflow creation and modification privileges to trusted users only.
    3. Avoid using untrusted HTML responses in the "Respond to Webhook" node.
    4. Consider using an external reverse proxy or HTML sanitizer to filter responses that include executable scripts.
rule: version > "0" && version < "1.114.0"
