  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2025-62726
  summary: n8n is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Git Node Pre-Commit Hook.
  details: |
    A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Git Node component of n8n.
    When a malicious actor clones a remote repository containing a pre-commit hook,
    the subsequent use of the Commit operation in the Git Node can inadvertently
    trigger the hook’s execution. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code
    within the n8n environment, potentially compromising the system and any connected
    credentials or workflows.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n v1.113.0 or later.
    2. For self-hosted deployments, set the environment variable `N8N_GIT_NODE_DISABLE_BARE_REPOS` to `true`.
    3. Avoid cloning or interacting with untrusted repositories using the Git Node.
    4. Disable or restrict the use of the Git Node in workflows where repository content cannot be fully trusted.
