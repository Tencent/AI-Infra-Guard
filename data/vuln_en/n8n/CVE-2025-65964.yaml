info:
  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2025-65964
  summary: n8n is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Git Node Custom Pre-Commit Hook.
  details: |
    The n8n Git node allows workflows to set arbitrary Git configuration values, including `core.hooksPath`.
    An attacker-controlled workflow can set this path to a directory within a cloned repository containing a Git hook (e.g., `pre-commit`), leading to arbitrary command execution on the n8n host.
    Successful exploitation requires the ability to create or modify an n8n workflow that uses the Git node.
  cvss: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n version 1.119.2 or later.
    2. If immediate upgrade is not possible, exclude the Git node.
    3. Avoid cloning or interacting with untrusted repositories using the Git Node.
rule: version >= "0.123.1" && version < "1.119.2"
