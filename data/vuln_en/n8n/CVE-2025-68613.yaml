info:
  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2025-68613
  summary: n8n is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Expression Injection, allowing authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code.
  details: |
    n8n contains a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in its workflow expression evaluation system. Under certain conditions, expressions supplied by authenticated users during workflow configuration may be evaluated in an execution context that is not sufficiently isolated from the underlying runtime.
    An authenticated attacker could abuse this behavior to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the n8n process. Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise of the affected instance, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of workflows, and execution of system-level operations.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n v1.122.0 or later.
    2. If immediate upgrade is not possible, limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only.
    3. Deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted operating system privileges and network access.
rule: version >= "0.211.0" && version < "1.120.4" || version >= "1.121.0" && version < "1.121.1"
