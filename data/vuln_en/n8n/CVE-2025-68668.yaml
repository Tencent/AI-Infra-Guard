info:
  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2025-68668
  summary: n8n is vulnerable to arbitrary command execution in its Pyodide-based Python Code Node due to a sandbox bypass.
  details: |
    An authenticated user with workflow creation/modification permissions can exploit a sandbox bypass vulnerability in the Python Code Node (which uses Pyodide) to execute arbitrary commands on the host system with the same privileges as the n8n process.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade n8n to version 2.0.0 or later, where a more secure task-runner-based native Python implementation is enabled by default.
    2. If upgrading to 2.0.0 is not immediately possible, for n8n versions 1.111.0 and above, configure `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED` and `N8N_NATIVE_PYTHON_RUNNER` environment variables to enable the task-runner-based native Python implementation.
    3. As a workaround, disable the Code Node entirely by setting the environment variable `NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.code\"]"`.
    4. Alternatively, for n8n versions 1.104.0 and above, disable Python support in the Code node by setting the environment variable `N8N_PYTHON_ENABLED=false`.
rule: version > "1.0.0" && version < "2.0.0"
