  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2025-68949
  summary: n8n's Webhook Node IP Whitelist Bypass via Partial String Matching allows attackers to bypass IP restrictions.
  details: |
    The Webhook node’s IP whitelist validation performed partial string matching instead of exact IP comparison.
    As a result, an incoming request could be accepted if the source IP address merely contained the configured whitelist entry as a substring.
    This issue affected instances where workflow editors relied on IP-based access controls to restrict webhook access, impacting both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
    An attacker with a non-whitelisted IP could bypass restrictions if their IP shared a partial prefix with a trusted address, undermining the intended security boundary.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n version 2.2.0 or later, where IP whitelist validation uses strict IP comparison logic.
    2. If immediate upgrade is not possible, avoid relying solely on IP whitelisting for webhook security.
    3. Implement additional authentication mechanisms such as shared secrets, HMAC signatures, or API keys.
    4. Avoid using short or prefix-based whitelist entries.
    5. Enforce IP filtering at the network layer (e.g., via reverse proxies or firewalls).
rule: version > "1.36.0" && version < "2.2.0"
