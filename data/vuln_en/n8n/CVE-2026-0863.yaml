info:
  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2026-0863
  summary: n8n Python sandbox escape via exception formatting and implicit code execution.
  details: |
    An attacker can bypass n8n's python-task-executor sandbox restrictions by using string formatting and exception handling,
    allowing arbitrary unrestricted Python code execution on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability can be
    exploited via the Code block by an authenticated user with basic permissions.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade n8n to a patched version that includes commit `b73a4283cb14e0f27ce19692326f362c7bf3da02` or newer.
    2. If operating under "Internal" execution mode, consider switching to "External" execution mode to mitigate the impact of arbitrary code execution.
    3. Restrict access to authenticated users with basic permissions to prevent exploitation.
