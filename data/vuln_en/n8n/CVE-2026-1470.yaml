  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2026-1470
  summary: n8n contains a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in its workflow Expression evaluation system.
  details: |
    n8n contains a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in its workflow Expression evaluation system. 
    Expressions supplied by authenticated users during workflow configuration may be evaluated in an execution context 
    that is not sufficiently isolated from the underlying runtime.
    An authenticated attacker could abuse this behavior to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the n8n process. 
    Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise of the affected instance, including unauthorized access to 
    sensitive data, modification of workflows, and execution of system-level operations.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade n8n to version 1.123.17 or later.
    2. If using n8n 2.x, upgrade to version 2.4.5 or later.
    3. If using n8n 2.5.x, upgrade to version 2.5.1 or later.
    4. Ensure that only trusted and authenticated users have access to configure workflows.
rule: (version > "0" && version < "1.123.17") || (version >= "2.0.0" && version < "2.4.5") || (version >= "2.5.0" && version < "2.5.1")
