info:
  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2026-21894
  summary: n8n's Stripe Trigger node is vulnerable to unauthenticated forged webhooks due to missing signature verification.
  details: |
    An authentication bypass in the Stripe Trigger node allows unauthenticated parties to trigger workflows by sending forged Stripe webhook events. The Stripe Trigger creates and stores a Stripe webhook signing secret, but incoming requests were not verified against this secret. This allows any HTTP client knowing the webhook URL to send a POST request with a matching event `type`, causing workflow execution as if a legitimate Stripe event was received.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n version 2.2.2 or later to ensure proper Stripe webhook signature verification.
    2. As a temporary mitigation, deactivate affected workflows or restrict access to workflows containing Stripe Trigger nodes to trusted users only.
rule: version > "0.150.0" && version < "2.2.2"
