  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2026-25051
  summary: n8n's improper CSP enforcement in webhook responses may allow stored XSS.
  details: |
    A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in n8n's handling of webhook responses and related HTTP endpoints.
    The Content Security Policy (CSP) sandbox protection may not be applied correctly, allowing an authenticated user
    with workflow creation/modification permissions to execute malicious scripts with same-origin privileges,
    potentially leading to session hijacking and account takeover.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n versions 1.122.5 or 1.123.2, or later.
    2. If immediate upgrade is not possible, limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only.
    3. Never execute untrusted workflows.
    4. Review workflows that receive data via webhooks, forms, or MCP servers to ensure communication with trusted entities before manual execution.
rule: (version > "0" && version < "1.122.5") || (version >= "1.123.0" && version < "1.123.2")
