info:
  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2026-25055
  summary: n8n is vulnerable to arbitrary file write on remote systems via the SSH node.
  details: |
    When n8n workflows process uploaded files and transfer them to remote servers via the SSH node without validating their metadata,
    it can lead to files being written to unintended locations on those remote systems. This could potentially result in remote code execution.
    An unauthenticated attacker would need knowledge of such workflows and unauthenticated file upload endpoints to exploit this vulnerability.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n version 2.4.0 or later.
    2. Upgrade to n8n version 1.123.12 or later.
    3. If immediate upgrade is not possible, consider disabling or restricting access to workflows that accept file uploads via webhooks and transfer them via SSH.
    4. Enable webhook authentication on all endpoints that handle file uploads.
    5. Review usage of SSH credentials and consider rotating them if in doubt.
