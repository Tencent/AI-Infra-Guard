  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2026-25115
  summary: Authenticated users can escape the Python sandbox in n8n's Python Code node.
  details: |
    A vulnerability in the Python Code node allows authenticated users to break out of the Python sandbox environment and execute code outside the intended security boundary. This issue affects deployments where Task Runners are enabled (`N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true`), Python is enabled (`N8N_PYTHON_ENABLED=true`), and the Code Node is enabled.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n version 2.4.8 or later.
    2. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, disable the Code Node by adding `n8n-nodes-base.code` to the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable.
    3. Prefer external mode for Task Runners (`N8N_RUNNERS_MODE=external`) to isolate untrusted task code in a separate sidecar container, reducing the risk of in-process memory disclosure.
rule: version > "0" && version < "2.4.8"
