  name: n8n
  cve: CVE-2026-25631
  summary: n8n's domain allowlist bypass enables credential exfiltration.
  details: |
    A vulnerability in the HTTP Request node's credential domain validation allowed an authenticated attacker to send requests with credentials to unintended domains, potentially leading to credential exfiltration. This primarily affects users with credentials using wildcard domain patterns (e.g., `*.example.com`) in the "Allowed domains" setting.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to n8n version 1.121.0 or later.
    2. Replace wildcard domain patterns with explicit domain listings in HTTP Request credentials.
    3. Review and restrict workflow creation/modification permissions to trusted users only.
    4. Audit existing workflows using HTTP Request nodes with domain-restricted credentials.
rule: version > "0" && version < "1.121.0"
