  summary: NVIDIA Triton Inference Server vulnerable to denial of service via excessive memory allocation
  details: |
    The NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability where a user can provide an invalid request that causes a memory allocation with an excessive size value. This leads to a segmentation fault and may result in a denial of service. The issue arises due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input before memory allocation.

    1. Upgrade to the latest version of NVIDIA Triton Inference Server once a patched release is available.
    2. Implement input validation on all incoming requests to prevent malformed or excessively large allocations.
    3. Monitor server logs for abnormal crashes or segmentation faults indicative of exploitation attempts.
