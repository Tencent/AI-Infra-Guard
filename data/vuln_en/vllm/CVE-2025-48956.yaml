  cve: CVE-2025-48956
  summary: vLLM API endpoints vulnerable to Denial of Service via large HTTP headers
  details: |
    A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in vLLM due to improper handling of excessively large HTTP headers. An unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger this by sending a single HTTP GET request with an extremely large header (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For: "A" * 5_800_000_000`). This causes the server to exhaust memory while attempting to process the request, potentially crashing or rendering the service unresponsive.
    The root cause lies in the lack of default HTTP header size limits in affected versions, allowing resource exhaustion without authentication.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to vLLM version 0.10.1.1 or later where HTTP header limits are enforced by default.
    2. As a temporary mitigation, deploy a reverse proxy (such as NGINX or Apache) in front of vLLM to restrict maximum header sizes.
    3. Monitor incoming traffic for unusually large headers and implement rate-limiting or filtering rules at the network level.
rule: version >= "0.1.0" && version < "0.10.1.1"
