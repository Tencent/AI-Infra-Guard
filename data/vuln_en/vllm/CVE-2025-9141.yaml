  cve: CVE-2025-9141
  summary: Remote code execution vulnerability in vLLM's Qwen3 Coder tool parser due to unsafe eval usage
  details: |
    The vulnerability exists in vLLM's Qwen3 Coder tool parser which uses Python's `eval()` function to parse tool call parameters when handling unknown data types. This occurs under specific conditions:
    
    1. Tool calling is enabled (`--enable-auto-tool-choice`)
    2. The qwen3_coder parser is specified (`--tool-call-parser qwen3_coder`)
    3. The parameter type is not explicitly defined or recognized
    
    An authenticated user who can influence the model to pass code as an argument to a tool call can trigger arbitrary code execution on the server.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade vLLM to version >= 0.10.1.1 immediately
    2. Avoid using the qwen3_coder tool parser until further validation
    3. Review and restrict access to tool calling endpoints
    4. Monitor for suspicious activity related to tool invocation
rule: version >= "0.10.0" && version < "0.10.1.1"
